#Rather than expanding on the original script, I am going to write new statements with the same result.

# 1. Make your script print another line.
print('In Python 3, print has changed from a statement to a function.')
print('In Python 2, you might write "print \'Hello!\'"')
print('In Python 3, you would write "print(\'Hello!\')"')
print('Since I am using Python', python_version(),'I use the function syntax.')

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
print('The purpose of these drills are to become confident in using print()')

# 3. Put a "#" (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
print('Another part of this exercise is to become familiar with code comments.')
print('In Python, single-line comments are indicated by the "#" character.')
print('Alternatively, a multi-line comment can be made using a set of \"\"\" characters.')
