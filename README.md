# pythonthehardway
A repository for exercises from Learn Python the Hard Way - 3rd Edition

Exercises will include more comments than usual, as the book as based on Python 2, but I will be using Python 3. I will be leveraging comments to show what the Python 2 code was and describe how the code has been transcribed to work in Python 3.
